title: DeFiChain Wiki Guidelines
description: The official guidelines for a new article. Uniform writing style and glossary. 
---

DeFiChain Wiki functions similar to Wikipedia (wikipedia.com) in a sense that everybody [can write an article](./Contribute.md) to best explain a certain topic of the DeFiChain ecosystem and to ultimately help others understand. A wiki should be always 'neutral' and use a similar writing style across all articles. To avoid confusion in a complex ecosystem, it is also very important to use always the same words for the same things. For that please refer to the [DeFiChain Glossary](./Glossary.md).

## Always write in 3rd person {#defichain-wiki-guidelines-point-of-view}

A DeFiChain Wiki article should always be written in 3rd person, as this is the most universal form of writing and naturally enforces a more precise writing style. Also the articles in this Wiki are witten by many different authors, pronouns like 'I', 'you', 'we', can mean something different for every article and reader. Here are a few examples: 

BAD: If the DeFiChain App Wallet does not work properly, you can help yourself by checking the debug.log file for error messages.
GOOD: If the DeFiChain App Wallet does not work properly, it can be helpful to check the debug.log file for error messages.

Another example could be: 

BAD: Here I describe a solution that works from time to time when the DeFi wallet does not start correctly. Sometimes even this approach does not work. First, please make sure you have a secure backup.
Good: This article describes a solution that works from time to time when the DeFi wallet does not start correctly. Sometimes even this approach does not work. A person should always have a secure backup, before trying this solution.
