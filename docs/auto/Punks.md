## Introduction {#introduction}

NFTs have entered the DeFiChain community with Punks and Jellyfishs. Numerous Telegram and Twitter users now use such an NFT as a profile picture, for example. This page serves as a guide to teach the basics about these NFT images:

#### What is an NFT? {#what-is-an-nft}

- NFT stands for "Non Fungible Token" which means that it cannot be replaced or exchanged as it has unique properties.
- It is a certificate of ownership for a digital file.

#### How is an NFT different from a cryptocurrency? {#how-is-an-nft-different-from-a-cryptocurrency}

- Money and cryptocurrencies are "fungible," meaning they can be traded or exchanged for each other. They also have the same value - a dollar is always worth another dollar; a bitcoin is always equal to another bitcoin. The fungibility of cryptocurrencies makes them a trusted means of conducting transactions on the blockchain.
- NFTs are different. Each punk has its own digital signature, which makes it impossible for NFTs to be exchanged for each other or be equivalent (therefore, they are not fungible).

#### Where and how are they managed? {#where-and-how-are-they-managed}

- Most NFTs are located on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs are individual tokens that store information. Since they have a value that is primarily determined by the market and demand, they can be bought and sold like other physical artworks.

#### What are NFTs used for? {#what-are-nfts-used-for}

- Blockchain technology and NFTs offer artists and content creators a unique way to market their products. For example, artists no longer have to rely on galleries or auction houses to sell their art.
- The unique data of NFTs makes it easy to verify and validate their ownership and the transfer of tokens between owners.

## NFT on OpenSea {#nft-on-opensea}

OpenSea's help page is located at: <https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us>.

#### Create an account {#create-an-account}

With [Getting Started](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/sections/360011539774-Getting-Started) you get to know different functions and possibilities on OpenSea. The three necessary steps to create your account are listed below as a link:

1.  [What crypto wallets can I use with OpenSea](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500007978402-What-crypto-wallets-can-I-use-with-OpenSea-) Since the rights to NFTs are stored on the ETH blockchain, it requires a wallet on OpenSea to buy and sell NFTs. The Metamask wallet is recommended as a browser extension. Unfortunately, the Metamask extension is not available for the Safari browser. Safari users can use the Coinbase wallet.
2.  [How do I create an OpenSea account?](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/360061676254-How-do-I-create-an-OpenSea-account-) In short, you need a wallet (see point 1. above) with an Ethereum address and ETH on it, and then the OpenSea account is created in a flip of a wrist.
3.  [How do I transfer ETH from Ethereum to Polygon?](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500012881642) Once you have your account with linked wallet, the almost most important point follows. Since the punks are anchored on the Polygon blockchain, the fees (gas-fee) can be saved from the ETH blockchain. However, this only works if the ETH are switched to wETH (wrapped-ETH) on the Polygon blockchain.

#### Paying with DFI? {#paying-with-dfi}

Why - why not? On OpenSea you can't pay directly with DFI, but on Telegram you can write to the provider and manually handle the purchase in DFI with them.

## Create punks individually {#create-punks-individually}

Beside the ready made punks on OpenSea there is the possibility to create your own punk and order it from me. On [Github](https://github.com/Martin8617/DFI-Punks) the corresponding service is offered. Try it out!

## Earn money with Jellyfish {#earn-money-with-jellyfish}

Are you interested in getting regular DFI with an NFT? On [Github](https://github.com/Maurice3005/DeFiChainNFTs) there is a corresponding offer. By buying a Defichain Jellyfish you acquire a share in a Masternode and get paid for its Staking-Reward.
