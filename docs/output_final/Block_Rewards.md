### DeFiChain Block Rewards

DeFiChain was initially launched with a 200 DFI block reward
approximately every 30-37 seconds. The Foundation pledges to guarantee
this 200 DFI block reward for at least 1,050,000 blocks since the first
genesis block, or approximately until August 2021.

After the first 1,050,000 blocks, block rewards will be adjusted through
governance vote.

The proposed staking schedule for the first 10 years is according to the
following table:
